The goal of this script is to build a game of tic-tac-toe using python and applying
some of the basic functions and modules of Python.
The best way to apporach every new project is to write down the idea in simple 
steps that can be then followed along during the creation.
# --- The Game of Tic-Tac-Toe ---
1. The basic representation of a game board will be a list of lists with size 3x3
2. The starting point will be represented by 0s and the "x" and "o" will be 
    represented by 1s and 2s (TODO: think over some functions in the future to
    represent the "x" and "o")
3. The user input will be determined by first location and then the symbol
