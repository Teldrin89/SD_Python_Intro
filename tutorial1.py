# initial comment
### The Python intro repo based on sentdex introduction series ###
The Python langauge is a veristile language that can be applied to many different
applications with the only drawback beeing slightly slower than some other languages 
(like for example C)
The basic python documentation is rich enough to always start searching for specific
solution: https://docs.python.org/3/

# the most basic thing a python can do is a print function
# this print function will print the text in double quotes (string)
print("Hello people!")
print("Just checking")
